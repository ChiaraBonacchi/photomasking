                    This application is very simple. When you participate,
                    the platform will load a photograph of an archaeological artefact.
                    Once the image has been loaded, you will be asked
  to click or tap around the edge of the artefact in order to define a
  polygon outline. Click once every time you wish to add a point along
  the edge of the polygon and yor final point will snap back onto the
  one you started with. In general, we would prefer you to draw ou polygon
  very slightly INSIDE the actual edge of the artefact. This is
  because we don't want background pixels near this edge to create a
  fuzzy border, and we don't need to worry so much about losign a bit
  of the artefact edge as the missing few pixels are very likely to
  appear in one of the other photogrpahs (at least 40 overlapping photographs are
  likely to exist for each object to support the construction of the
  3d model). An example of a successful outline made up two
  overlapping polygons is shown below (it could also have been done as just one polygon).

                In a few cases, there might be one or more holes
                in the object shown in the photograph, and you will
                be given an opportunity to draw these holes in a
                second step, after you have created the initial outline
                around the object. During the task, you can always return to this tutorial via the "Help" button.
