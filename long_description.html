        This application will help a variety of research projects to
    create high quality 3d models of archaeological artefacts. There
    has been a revolution in 3d modelling in recent years and it is now relatively
    easy to construct such models from ordinary digital
    photographs. Isolating the objects depicted in these photographs,
    and masking out the background, is an important first step to achieving high
    quality results. The final 3d models will be made publicly available and are useful
    not only for basic documentation purposes, but also for graphical displays in museums, for
    inclusion in gaming and virtual reality environments, or for
    identifing different sub-styles in otherwise similar types of
    artefact (that might tell us about the date of the artefact, where
    it was made, or by whom). The photos that you could be assigned
    here might come from any number of different projects, and for now are
    assigned completely at random, although we are looking into allowing
    regular contributors to choose which projects they prefer to work
    on.</p>
        <p>
        We would like people to draw one or more polygons around the
    object that they see in each photograph in order to identify the
    outline of the object and exclude the image background. This allows
    the 3d modelling process to concentrate on the object itself and
    ignore irrelevant information.
        </p>

    <p>An example of one of these models has now been produced and can be <a target="_blank" href="http://micropasts.org/3D">seen here</a>.</p>
